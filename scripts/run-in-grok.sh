# Builds the engine if needed, then starts an interactive Grok session with
# the engine connected as an MCP server, so you can prompt it:
#
#   scripts/run-in-grok.sh              # then type prompts
#   scripts/run-in-grok.sh "What version is the Logix engine?"
#
# The same as scripts/run-in-claude.sh, with Grok as the host. Arguments are
# passed to grok. Grok runs in a playground folder, ~/.logix-dev/playground
# (or LOGIX_PLAYGROUND), where it can create designs, not in this repo. The
# engine uses the engine folder ~/.logix-dev/engine (or
# LOGIX_ENGINE_FOLDER), and logs at LOGIX_LOG_LEVEL (info by default; debug
# also logs every program's output). The engine's tools are allowed without
# asking. Each run starts the freshly built engine, copied to
# ~/.logix-dev/bin so the session doesn't see this repo's path.
#
# For a reproducible starting point, the session has Grok's memory off,
# loads none of Claude Code's files (such as ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md), and gets
# the rules in scripts/_test-session.sh: start only from what the engine
# provides, and don't read local repos or earlier notes. The rules ask the
# agent; they don't enforce.
#
# Grok has no option to hand it an MCP server for one session, so this
# script writes the engine into the playground's project config,
# <playground>/.grok/config.toml, on every run, and trusts the playground
# folder so Grok starts it. MCP servers in your own Grok config
# (~/.grok/config.toml) are loaded too.
#
# Unlike Claude Code, Grok doesn't accept --add-dir, so name work folders in
# the prompt instead; the engine's tools take any folder.
#
# Uses the grok command on the PATH, or else ~/.grok/bin/grok.
#
# Prerequisites: the same as scripts/run-in-claude.sh, with Grok instead of
# Claude Code, installed and signed in (run grok once by hand to sign in).
